Changes since the last public release (1.5.14):

Version 1.5.15beta01 [February 4, 2013]
  Enabled renaming of the extern (but not DLL exported) ARM filter functions.
    Also enabled inclusion of pngpriv.h in non-C files by preventing C/C++
    specific definitions if PNG_VERSION_INFO_ONLY is defined.
  Added png_get_palette_max() function.

Version 1.5.15beta02 [February 5, 2013]
  Made a probably general fix for the preprocessing used to generate source
    files. This change might make the check for a special C preprocessor
    unnecessary, and it also eliminates the requirement for sed in the
    configure build process.
  Fix typo in Makefile.am, fix scripts/pnglibconf.mak and makefile.std
  Rebuilt Makefile.in, configure, etc., with autoconf-2.69 and automake-1.13
  Fix 'setting' handling in options.awk and fixed palette_max API

Version 1.5.15beta03 [February 7, 2013]
  Remove SUN OS cc -E workround - no longer required
  Turn serial tests back on (recently turned off by autotools upgrade).

Version 1.5.15beta04 [February 7, 2013]
