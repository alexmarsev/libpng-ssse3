Changes since the last public release (1.5.14):

Version 1.5.15beta01 [February 4, 2013]
  Enabled renaming of the extern (but not DLL exported) ARM filter functions.
    Also enabled inclusion of pngpriv.h in non-C files by preventing C/C++
    specific definitions if PNG_VERSION_INFO_ONLY is defined.
  Added png_get_palette_max() function.

Version 1.5.15beta02 [February 5, 2013]
  Made a probably general fix for the preprocessing used to generate source
    files. This change might make the check for a special C preprocessor
    unnecessary, and it also eliminates the requirement for sed in the
    configure build process.
  Fix typo in Makefile.am, fix scripts/pnglibconf.mak and makefile.std
  Rebuilt Makefile.in, configure, etc., with autoconf-2.69 and automake-1.13
  Fix 'setting' handling in options.awk and fixed palette_max API

Version 1.5.15beta03 [February 7, 2013]
  Remove SUN OS cc -E workround - no longer required
  Turn serial tests back on (recently turned off by autotools upgrade).

Version 1.5.15beta04 [February 15, 2013]
  Enclosed the new png_get_palette_max in #ifdef PNG_GET_PALETTE_MAX_SUPPORTED
    block, and revised pnglibconf.h and pnglibconf.h.prebuilt accordingly.

Version 1.5.15beta05 [February 16, 2013]
  Use approved/supported Android method to check for NEON, use Linux/POSIX
    1003.1 API to check /proc/self/auxv avoiding buffer allocation and other
    library calls.
  Fixed a race condition in the creation of the build 'scripts' directory
    while building with a parallel make.
